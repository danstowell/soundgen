### UTILITIES FOR POSP-PROCESSING OF PITCH CONTOURS ###

#' Cost of jumps
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for calculating the cost of transitions between
#' pitch candidates. Needed for postprocessing of pitch contour - finding the
#' optimal pitch contour.
#' @param cand1,cand2 two candidate pitch values
#' @examples
#' a = seq(-3, 3, by = .01)
#' b = 1 / (1 + 10 * exp(3 - 7 * abs(a)))
#' plot(a, b, type = 'l')

}


#' Find gradient
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing of pitch contour. Returns
#' gradient of internal energy of a snake. See \code{\link{snake}}.
#' @param path numeric vector corresponding to a path through pitch candidates
#' @param interpol the number of points to interpolate beyond each end of the path
#' @return Returns a vector of the same length as input path giving its 4th derivative.

  # interpolate 2 values before the first one and two after the last one based
  # on /interpol/ number of points in case the path is shorter than the

#' Force per path
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing of pitch contour. Returns the
#' total force acting on a snake (sum of internal and external gradients, i.e.
#' of the elastic force trying to straighten the snake [internal] and of the
#' force pushing the snake towards the most certain pitch estimates [external])
#' @param
#' @return Returns ???
#' @examples

#' Snake
#'

#' Median smoothing
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for smoothing pitch contours or other contours. Only

#'   contours can be fed into this function at once to speed things up)
#' @param smoothing_ww width of smoothing window (points)
