### UTILITIES FOR POSP-PROCESSING OF PITCH CONTOURS ###

#' Cost of jumps
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for calculating the cost of transitions between
#' pitch candidates. Needed for postprocessing of pitch contour - finding the
#' optimal pitch contour.
#' @param cand1,cand2 two candidate pitch values
#' @examples
#' a = seq(-3, 3, by = .01)
#' b = 1 / (1 + 10 * exp(3 - 7 * abs(a)))
#' plot(a, b, type = 'l')

  return (1 / (1 + 10 * exp(3 - 7 * abs(cand1 - cand2))))
}


#' Find gradient
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing of pitch contour. Returns
#' the elastic force acting on a snake. See \code{\link{snake}}.
#' @param path numeric vector corresponding to a path through pitch candidates
#' @param interpol the number of points to interpolate beyond each end of the path
#' @return Returns a vector of the same length as input path giving its 4th derivative.

  if (interpol == 1) {
    path = c(rep(path[1], 2), path, rep(path[length(path)], 2))
  } else {
    slopeLeft = summary(lm(path[1:interpol] ~ seq(1, interpol)))$coef[2, 1]
    minus12 = path[1] - c(1, 2) * slopeLeft

#' Force per path
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing of pitch contour. Returns the
#' total force acting on a snake (sum of internal and external gradients, i.e.
#' of the elastic force trying to straighten the snake [internal] and of the
#' force pushing the snake towards the most certain pitch estimates [external])
#' @inheritParams snake
#' @return Returns a numeric vector of the same length as \code{pitch} that
#'   gives the total force acting on the snake at each point.

  # weighted average of internal and external forces

}


#' Snake
#'
#' Internal soundgen function.
#'
#' Internal helper function for postprocessing of pitch contour. Wiggles a snake
#' along the gradient of internal + external forces. NB: if the snake is run,
#' the final contour may deviate from the actually measured pitch candidates!
#' @param pitch numeric vector representing our best guess for pitch contour,
#'   which we are now attempting to improve by minimizing its elastic tension
#' @param pitchCands a matrix of multiple pitch candidates per frame from
#'   pathfinder
#' @param pitchCert a matrix of the same dimensionality as pitchCands specifying
#'   our certainty in pitch candidates
#' @inheritParams analyze
#' @return Returns optimized pitch contour (numeric vector of the same length as
#'   \code{pitch}).
