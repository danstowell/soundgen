Description: Tools for acoustic analysis and parametric synthesis of harmonic sounds.
    Generates a combination of sine waves and noise filtered to add formants. 
    The resulting sound can contain multiple harmonics, noise components, a flexible spectral envelope, effects like subharmonics or jitter, and one or more syllables.
    This can be used to synthesize vocalizations of animals or human voice. 
    Soundgen can be used as a command-line tool in R console or as an interactive Shiny app. 
    Note that soundgen is not intended as a text-to-speech engine.
